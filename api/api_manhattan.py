"""
Manhattan API - Authentication module
Provides FastAPI endpoints for API key management used by themanhattanproject.ai.

Features:
- Create API key for a user (returns plaintext key once)
- Validate an API key (dependency that other endpoints can use)
- List and revoke keys owned by the authenticated user

This is intentionally lightweight and stores key metadata in a local JSON file; for
production use replace the storage layer with a secure database and rotate keys.
